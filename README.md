# Active Neural SLAM

#### This is an educational webapp designed to serve 3 purposes:

1. Design a full stack web app with python (streamlit as frontend, postgres backend)
2. Serve as a frontpage for my M.S. project which will attempt to autonomously fly a drone using an active neural SLAM approach 
3. General information and references about active neural SLAM
