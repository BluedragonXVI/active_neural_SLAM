# Active Neural SLAM Portal

#### This is an educational webapp designed to serve 3 purposes:

1. Design a web app with python (stateful implementation of streamlit using postgres to store session ID's)
2. Serve as a frontpage for my M.S. project which will attempt to autonomously fly a drone using an active neural SLAM approach 
3. General information and references about SLAM, as well as it's active and neural variants 

#### Use the side page navbar to learn more
